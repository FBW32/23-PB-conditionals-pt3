# Programming Basics: Conditionals (Exercises using maths and In-Built Objects)

**Print your results to the console**

1. Make a variable for firstName and age and give each variable values. Create an if/else statement to check whether the person's age is less than 13. If so, print "firstName is a boy/girl". If the age is equal to or more than 13 and less than 20, print "firstName is a teenager". If the person's age is equal to 20 and less than 30, then print "firstName is a young man/woman". If none of these conditions apply, print "firstName is a man/woman". 

2. John and Mike both play basketball in different teams. In the latest 3 games, John's team scored 89, 120 and 103 points, while Mike's team scored 116, 94 and 123 points.
- 2a) Calculate the average score for each team.
- 2b) Decide which teams wins in average (highest average score), and print the winner to the console. Also include the average score in the output.
- 2c) Then change the scores to show different winners. Don't forget to take into account there might be a draw (the same average score).
- 2d) Mary also plays basketball, and her team scored 97, 134 and 105 points. Like before, log the average winner to the console.
- 2e) Like before, change the scores to generate different winners, keeping in mind there might be draws.

3. In a test, six students each scored 90, 64, 75, 83, 80 and 55 respectively. Calculate the average mark and then give each student a grade, using the following guide:
 
- A+ if the average is greater than 90. 
- A if the average is greater than 80 and less than or equal to 90	. 
- B+ if the average is greater than 70 and less than or equal to 80. 
- B if the average is greater than 60 and less than or equal to 70. 
- C+ if the average is greater than 50 and less than or equal to 60. 
- C if the average is greater than 40  and less than or equal to 50. 
- D if the average is greater than 30 and less than or equal to 40. 
- F if the average is less than or equal to 30.

4. Make an if/else statement depending on the weather today! Create a variable named "temperature" and "weather". Then, create outputs based on the variable values e.g. It is ${temperature} degrees outside and ${weather}.`

5. Conditionals & Date built-in object.

Depending on the time and the language set in the UI/browser, show a message in the console. You want to be able to simulate and test your code. Be creative & have fun. Don't copy code, write your own (use the "Reference" to help you out!) Example of message:

>00:00 - 06:59
>"Good night!"
>"Gute Nacht!"
>"Buonanotte!"
>
>07:00 - 11:59
>"Good morning!"
>"Guten Morgen!"
>"Buongiorno!"
>
>12:00 - 17:59
>"Hello!"
>"Guten Tag!"
>"Buona giornata!"
>
>18:00 - 23:59
>"Good evening!"
>"Guten Abend!"
>"Buonasera!"

6. Determine whether a given year is a leap year in the Gregorian calendar.
