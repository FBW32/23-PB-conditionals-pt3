# Programming Basics: Conditionals Part 3 

Attempt this exercise using only simple "if" conditionals (and only what you have learnt this far into the course, so no loops or functions just yet!) 

**Print your results to the console**

1. Aleeza and Lis both play basketball in different teams. In the latest 3 games, John's team scored 89, 120 and 103 points, while Mike's team scored 116, 94 and 123 points.
- 1a) Calculate the average score for each team.
- 1b) Decide which teams wins in average (highest average score), and print the winner to the console, including their average score in the output.
- 1c) Then change the scores to show different winners. Don't forget to take into account there might be a draw (the same average score).
- 1d) Mary also plays basketball, and her team scored 97, 134 and 105 points. Like before, log the average winner to the console.
- 1e) Like before, change the scores to generate different winners, keeping in mind there might be draws.
